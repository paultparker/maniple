and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Blocked-on-question detection: a master session can now detect when a worker is stalled on an `AskUserQuestion` prompt (which stop-hook idle detection misses) and answer it.
  - `wait_for_worker` MCP tool — blocking wait that distinguishes `idle` / `waiting_input` / `stuck`.
  - `answer_worker_question` MCP tool — answer a worker's pending question by option number, including multi-select via a keystroke sequence.
  - `list_blocked_workers` MCP tool — marker-directory-wide scan for workers blocked on a question.
  - `worker_waiting_input` event type.
  - AskUserQuestion `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` marker hooks injected into workers, with the pending-question marker cleared when a worker is closed.
- `trust_project_mcp` parameter on `spawn_workers` (default `True`) to control auto-approval of a project's `.mcp.json` servers.

### Fixed
- Workers no longer stall at Claude's "New MCP server found" trust prompt — which the agent-ready detector misreported as a launch failure. Project `.mcp.json` servers are auto-approved by default; pass `trust_project_mcp=False` per worker to preserve the prompt for untrusted checkouts.
- Resolve an order-dependent circular import between `registry` and `utils.errors`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Add `plugin_dir` parameter support for Claude Code workers.

### Fixed
- Suppress Codex CLI update prompts in unattended worker runs.
- Search for session marker from JSONL beginning to improve startup marker correlation.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Add Codex ready-pattern match for `% left` (Codex CLI v0.106+), preventing false startup timeouts in `spawn_workers`.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- `list_workers` now hides closed recovered sessions by default, preventing massive output that blows up agent context windows. Pass `include_closed=True` to see them.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- **Rename `annotation` → `badge`**: All user-facing parameters, session metadata fields, and docs now use `badge` / `coordinator_badge`. The `annotation` name has been fully removed (no aliases, no backward compat).

## [0.11.2]

- Fix Linux/non-macOS startup: if iTerm backend is selected implicitly but iTerm init fails, fall back to tmux when available.

## [0.11.1]

- Fix PyPI distribution name: publish as `maniple-mcp` (PyPI rejects `maniple`).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Rename: claude-team → maniple**: CLI is now `maniple`, Python packages are `maniple` / `maniple_mcp`, and the config directory is `~/.maniple` (with migration support for legacy names). (#25)

### Fixed
- **tmux recovery during rename transition**: Improved tmux session discovery/adoption reliability when recovering existing workers after restart. (#25)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **Renamed `bead` parameter to `issue_id`**: `spawn_workers` now uses `issue_id` instead of `bead` for tracker-agnostic issue assignment. `bead` is still accepted as a deprecated alias. (#23)

### Documentation
- **`coordinator_annotation` clarified**: Documented that this field is coordinator-facing metadata, not task delivery. Tasks must be sent via follow-up message. (#22)
- **`agent_type` parameter guidance**: Added note that this field should not be specified unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **`worktree.base` documentation improved**: Clearer explanation of base branch resolution for worktrees. (#24)

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Codex worker log discovery**: `read_worker_logs` no longer returns wrong session data (e.g. coordinator's own logs) for Codex workers. Removed blind `find_codex_session_file()` fallback that grabbed the most recent Codex JSONL globally regardless of session ownership.
- **Codex JSONL path caching**: Codex workers now cache their JSONL path at spawn time (parity with Claude workers), via new `await_codex_marker_in_jsonl()` polling.
- **Discovery window**: Increased `max_age_seconds` from 600 (10 min) to 86400 (24h) for Codex session file scanning — workers can run for hours.
- **RecoveredSession crashes**: Fixed `discover_workers`, `adopt_worker`, and `spawn_workers` crashing with `'RecoveredSession' object has no attribute 'terminal_session'` when recovered sessions exist in the registry.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **MCP tool optional param validation**: All 9 MCP tools now accept `null` for optional parameters with defaults. MCP clients (e.g. mcporter) that send explicit `null` for omitted params no longer trigger pydantic validation errors.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Event log recovery**: On startup, the registry reconstructs worker state from `events.jsonl`. `list_workers` now shows all known workers (live + recovered) instead of returning empty after restart.
  - `RecoveredSession` dataclass for restored workers (read-only, no terminal handle)
  - `RecoveryReport` with counts of added/skipped/closed sessions
  - Eager recovery at boot + lazy fallback in `list_workers`
- **`worker_events` MCP tool**: Query the event log programmatically with timestamp filters, summaries, stuck worker detection, and project filtering. Replaces shell-script parsing of `events.jsonl`.
- **`stale_threshold_minutes` config**: Configurable via `~/.maniple/config.json` (`events.stale_threshold_minutes`, default: 10). `poll_worker_changes` reads from config when param not passed, tool param overrides.
- **`source` field in `list_workers`**: Distinguishes `"registry"` (live) vs `"event_log"` (recovered) workers.
- 98 new tests across 6 test files for recovery, worker_events, config, and poll_worker_changes.

### Changed
- **README**: Comprehensive rewrite — documents tmux backend, config file, Codex support, `poll_worker_changes`, HTTP mode, correct worktree paths, updated architecture diagram.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **tmux session naming**: Worktree paths no longer create separate tmux sessions per worker. Removed hash from session names — format is now `maniple-{slug}` (e.g. `maniple-pagedrop-infra`). All workers for the same project share one tmux session with separate windows.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **System-wide config file** (`~/.maniple/config.json`): Centralized configuration replacing environment variables
  - Typed dataclasses with JSON validation
  - Version field for future migrations
  - Precedence: env var → config file → built-in default
- **Config CLI**: `maniple config init|show|get|set` commands
- **Per-project tmux sessions**: Each project gets its own tmux session (`maniple-<slug>-<hash>`) instead of a single shared session
  - Easier local monitoring — `tmux ls` shows projects separately
  - Discovery scans all tmux panes and filters by managed prefix

### Fixed
- Worktree branch/directory names capped at 30 chars to avoid filesystem limits
- Test isolation from user config file (tests no longer affected by `~/.maniple/config.json`)

### Changed
- Tmux `list_sessions` and discovery now scan all sessions with prefix filter instead of targeting a single session

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Tmux terminal backend**: Run workers in tmux sessions instead of iTerm2
- Terminal backend abstraction layer (`TerminalBackend` protocol)
- Backend auto-detection: uses tmux if `$TMUX` is set, otherwise iTerm
- `MANIPLE_TERMINAL_BACKEND` env var for explicit backend selection
- One tmux window per worker with descriptive naming (`<name> | <project> [<issue>]`)
- Tmux discovery and adoption of orphaned worker sessions
- Codex discovery/adopt fallbacks for tmux
- New test suite: `tests/test_tmux_backend.py`

### Fixed
- Close Codex via Ctrl+C instead of `/exit`
- `wait_idle_workers` Codex idle detection
- Explicit worktree config now fails loudly instead of silent fallback

### Changed
- All tools refactored to operate on `TerminalSession` rather than iTerm-specific handles
- Default behavior (no explicit worktree config) still falls back but returns warnings

## [0.6.1] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Correct Codex skip-permissions flag (use `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- **Issue tracker abstraction**: Support for both Beads and Pebbles issue trackers
- Auto-detection of issue tracker based on project structure (`.beads/` vs `.pebbles/`)
- `issue_tracker_help` tool replaces `bd_help` with tracker-agnostic guidance
- Comprehensive test suite for issue tracker detection and integration

### Changed
- Worker prompts now use generic issue tracker commands instead of hardcoded Beads
- Worktree detection improved with better branch name parsing

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- Handle worktree name collisions with incrementing suffix (e.g., `feature-1`, `feature-2`)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Codex support**: spawn, message, and monitor Codex workers
- Multi-agent CLI abstraction layer
- `MANIPLE_CODEX_COMMAND` env var for custom Codex binary
- Codex JSONL schema and parsing
- Codex idle detection
- Star Trek duos to worker name sets

### Fixed
- Don't require `maniple` iTerm2 profile to exist
- Codex ready patterns for v0.80.0
- Dynamic delay for Codex based on prompt length
- `read_worker_logs` now works for Codex sessions

## [0.3.2] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- Skip `--settings` flag for custom commands like Happy

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- `MANIPLE_COMMAND` env var support for custom Claude binaries (e.g., Happy)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- HTTP mode (`--http`) for persistent state across requests
- Streamable HTTP transport for MCP
- launchd integration for running as background service

### Changed
- Server can now run as persistent HTTP service instead of stdio-only

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- Corrected `close_workers` docstring about branch retention

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- Git worktree support for isolated worker branches
- Worker state persistence

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added
